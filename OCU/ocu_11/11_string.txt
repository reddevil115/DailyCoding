For example, suppose 10,000 bytes are sent in 10 different TCP packets, and the first packet is lost during transmission.  In a pure cumulative acknowledgment protocol, the receiver cannot say that it received bytes 1,000 to 9,999 successfully, but failed to receive the first packet, containing bytes 0 to 999.  Thus the sender may then have to resend all 10,000 bytes.
